AI Based Wellness And Performance Recommendation Systen for Students

The AI-Based Wellness and Performance Recommendation System is developed to enhance student well-being and academic success through intelligent, personalized recommendations. The system automatically monitors studentsâ€™ mental wellness by passively collecting behavioral and usage data from their smartphones, such as screen time, activity levels, and usage patterns. Academic performance data, however, is manually entered by the students.

Using this combined data, the system employs AI techniques to analyze wellness trends and academic progress. It then generates personalized tips to help students improve focus, reduce stress, and enhance learning efficiency. Admin users are provided tools to manage students, monitor system health, and fine-tune the AI recommendation models. The platform supports continuous self-improvement through data-driven insights and visual feedback.
